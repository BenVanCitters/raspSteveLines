Jazz Music Visualizer
This is a project dedicated to Johnny Muller who will be missed.  It is a project that deals with openFrameworks and GLSL specifically configured to work on the raspberry pi

In it's current state the app is meant to run on a raspbian raspberry pi with a webcam attached that has a microphone.  If these conditions are me it will put out a waveform display and then do some cool shader FX with those.
